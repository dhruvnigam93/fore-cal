The proposed database can be used to solve two practically important problems: predicting complications of Myocardial Infarction (MI) based on information about the patient (i) at the time of admission and (ii) on the third day of the hospital period. Another important group of tasks is phenotyping of disease (cluster analysis), dynamic phenotyping (filament extraction and identification of disease trajectories) and visualisation (disease mapping). \r\nMI is one of the most challenging problems of modern medicine. Acute myocardial infarction is associated with high mortality in the first year after it. The incidence of MI remains high in all countries. This is especially true for the urban population of highly developed countries, which is exposed to chronic stress factors, irregular and not always balanced nutrition. In the United States, for example, more than a million people suffer from MI every year, and 200-300 thousand of them die from acute MI before arriving at the hospital. \r\nThe course of the disease in patients with MI is different. MI can occur without complications or with complications that do not worsen the long-term prognosis. At the same time, about half of patients in the acute and subacute periods have complications that lead to worsening of the disease and even death. Even an experienced specialist can not always foresee the development of these complications. In this regard, predicting complications of myocardial infarction in order to timely carry out the necessary preventive measures is an important task. \r\n\r\nProblems to solve\r\nIn general columns 2-112 can be used as input data for prediction. Possible complications (outputs) are listed in columns 113-124.\r\nThere are four possible time moments for complication prediction: on base of the information known at\r\n1.\tthe time of admission to hospital: all input columns (2-112) except 93, 94, 95, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105 can be used for prediction;\r\n2.\tthe end of the first day (24 hours after admission to the hospital): all input columns (2-112) except 94, 95, 101, 102, 104, 105 can be used for prediction;\r\n3.\tthe end of the second day (48 hours after admission to the hospital) all input columns (2-112) except 95, 102, 105 can be used for prediction;\r\n4.\tthe end of the third day (72 hours after admission to the hospital) all input columns (2-112) can be used for prediction.\r\n\r\nYou can find detailed description of database, descriptive statistics and csv version of database in DOI: 10.25392/leicester.data.12045261.v3\r\n", "purpose": null, "funded_by": null, "instances_represent": null, "recommended_data_splits": null, "sensitive_data": null, "preprocessing_description": null, "variable_info": "Table of abbreviations\r\nFC is the functional class of angina pectoris in the last year according to Campeau, L., 1976.

(In the biological community, IE borders are referred to a ``acceptors'' while EI borders are referred to as ``donors''.)\r\n\r\nThis dataset has been developed to help evaluate a \"hybrid\" learning algorithm (KBANN) that uses examples to inductively refine preexisting knowledge.  Using a \"ten-fold cross-validation\" methodology on 1000 examples randomly selected from the complete set of 3190, the following  error rates were produced by various ML algorithms (all experiments run at the Univ of Wisconsin, sometimes with local implementations of published algorithms). \r\n\r\nSystem -- Neither -- EI -- IE\r\n---------------------------------------------------\r\nKBANN -- 4.62 -- 7.56 --  8.47\r\nBACKPROP -- 5.29 --  5.74 -- 10.75\r\nPEBLS -- 6.86 -- 8.18 -- 7.55\r\nPERCEPTRON -- 3.99 -- 16.32 -- 17.41\r\nID3 -- 8.84 -- 10.58 -- 13.99\r\nCOBWEB  -- 11.80 -- 15.04 -- 9.46\r\nNear.

SUPPORT comprised a two-year prospective observational study (Phase I) followed by a two-year controlled clinical trial (Phase II). Phase I of SUPPORT collected data from patients accessioned during 1989-1991 to characterize the care, treatment preferences, and patterns of decision-making among critically ill patients. It also served as a preliminary step for devising an intervention strategy for improving critically-ill patients' care and for the construction of statistical models for predicting patient prognosis and functional status. An intervention was implemented in Phase II of SUPPORT, which accessioned patients during 1992-1994. The Phase II intervention provided physicians with accurate predictive information on future functional ability, survival probability to six months, and patients' preferences for end-of-life care. Additionally, a skilled nurse was provided as part of the intervention to elicit patient preferences, provide prognoses, enhance understanding, enable palliative care, and facilitate advance planning. The intervention was expected to increase communication, resulting in earlier decisions to have orders against resuscitation, decrease time that patients spent in undesirable states (e.g., in the Intensive Care Unit, on a ventilator, and in a coma), increase physician understanding of patients' preferences for care, decrease patient pain, and decrease hospital resource use. Data collection in both phases of SUPPORT consisted of questionnaires administered to patients, their surrogates, and physicians, plus chart reviews for abstracting clinical, treatment, and decision information. Phase II also collected information regarding the implementation of the intervention, such as patient-specific logs maintained by nurses assigned to patients as part of the intervention. SUPPORT patients were followed for six months after inclusion in the study. Those who did not die within six months or were lost to follow-up were matched against the National Death Index to identify deaths through 1997. Patients who did not die within one year or were lost to follow-up were matched against the National Death Index to identify deaths through 1997.\nAll patients in five United States medical centers who met inclusion and exclusion criteria for nine disease categories: acute respiratory failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, liver disease, coma, colon cancer, lung cancer, multiple organ system failure with malignancy, and multiple organ system failure with sepsis.

The CO2, sound and PIR sensors needed manual calibration. For the CO2 sensor, zero-point calibration was manually done before its first use by keeping it in a clean environment for over 20 minutes and then pulling the calibration pin (HD pin) low for over 7s. The sound sensor is essentially a microphone with a variable-gain analog amplifier attached to it. Therefore, the output of this sensor is analog which is read by the microcontroller\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ADC in volts. The potentiometer tied to the gain of the amplifier was adjusted to ensure the highest sensitivity. The PIR sensor has two trimpots: one to tweak the sensitivity and the other to tweak the time for which the output stays high after detecting motion. Both of these were adjusted to the highest values. Sensor nodes S1-S4 consisted of temperature, light and sound sensors, S5 had a CO2 sensor and S6 and S7 had one PIR sensor each that were deployed on the ceiling ledges at an angle that maximized the sensor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s field of view for motion detection.\n\nThe data was collected for a period of 4 days in a controlled manner with the occupancy in the room varying between 0 and 3 people.

The value of \"Exit Rate\" feature for a specific web page is calculated as for all pageviews to the page, the percentage that were the last in the session. The \"Page Value\" feature represents the average value for a web page that a user visited before completing an e-commerce transaction.

They are of considerable scientific interest as probes of space-time, the inter-stellar medium, and states of matter (see [2] for more uses). \r\n\r\nAs pulsars rotate, their emission beam sweeps across the sky, and when this crosses our line of sight, produces a detectable pattern of broadband radio emission. As pulsars\r\nrotate rapidly, this pattern repeats periodically. Thus pulsar search involves looking for periodic radio signals with large radio telescopes.\r\n\r\nEach pulsar produces a slightly different emission pattern, which varies slightly with each rotation (see [2] for an introduction to pulsar astrophysics to find out why). Thus a  potential signal detection known as a 'candidate', is averaged over many rotations of the pulsar, as determined by the length of an observation. In the absence of additional info, each candidate could potentially describe a real pulsar. However in practice almost all detections are caused by radio frequency interference (RFI) and noise, making legitimate signals hard to find.\r\n\r\nMachine learning tools are now being used to automatically label pulsar candidates to facilitate rapid analysis. Classification systems in particular are being widely adopted,\r\n(see [4,5,6,7,8,9]) which treat the candidate data sets  as binary classification problems. Here the legitimate pulsar examples are a minority positive class, and spurious examples the majority negative class. At present multi-class labels are unavailable, given the costs associated with data annotation.\r\n\r\nThe data set shared here contains 16,259 spurious examples caused by RFI/noise, and 1,639 real pulsar examples. These examples have all been checked by human annotators. \r\n\r\nThe data is presented in two formats: CSV and ARFF (used by the WEKA data mining tool). Candidates are stored in both files in separate rows. Each row lists the variables first, and the class label is the final entry.

Cherenkov gamma telescope observes high energy gamma rays, taking advantage of the radiation emitted by charged particles produced inside the electromagnetic showers initiated by the gammas, and developing in the atmosphere. This Cherenkov radiation (of visible to UV wavelengths) leaks through the atmosphere and gets recorded in the detector, allowing reconstruction of the shower parameters. The available information consists of pulses left by the incoming Cherenkov photons on the photomultiplier tubes, arranged in a plane, the camera. Depending on the energy of the primary gamma, a total of few hundreds to some 10000 Cherenkov photons get collected, in patterns (called the shower image), allowing to discriminate statistically those caused by primary gammas (signal) from the images of hadronic showers initiated by cosmic rays in the upper atmosphere (background).\r\n\r\nTypically, the image of a shower after some pre-processing is an elongated cluster. Its long axis is oriented towards the camera center if the shower axis is parallel to the telescope's optical axis, i.e. if the telescope axis is directed towards a point source. A principal component analysis is performed in the camera plane, which results in a correlation axis and defines an ellipse. If the depositions were distributed as a bivariate Gaussian, this would be an equidensity ellipse. The characteristic parameters of this ellipse (often called Hillas parameters) are among the image parameters that can be used for discrimination. The energy depositions are typically asymmetric along the major axis, and this asymmetry can also be used in discrimination. There are, in addition, further discriminating characteristics, like the extent of the cluster in the image plane, or the total sum of depositions.\r\n\r\nThe data set was generated by a Monte Carlo program, Corsika, described in:\r\n    D.
