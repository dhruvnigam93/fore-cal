Bohanec, V. Rajkovic: Expert system for decision making. Sistemica 1(1), pp. 145-157, 1990.). The model evaluates cars according to the following concept structure:\r\n\r\nCAR                      car acceptability\r\n. PRICE                  overall price\r\n. . buying               buying price\r\n. . maint                price of the maintenance\r\n. TECH                   technical characteristics\r\n. .

Besides the target concept (CAR), the model includes three intermediate concepts: PRICE, TECH, COMFORT. Every concept is in the original model related to its lower level descendants by a set of examples (for these examples sets see http://www-ai.ijs.si/BlazZupan/car.html).\r\n\r\nThe Car Evaluation Database contains examples with the structural information removed, i.e., directly relates CAR to the six input attributes: buying, maint, doors, persons, lug_boot, safety.\r\n\r\nBecause of known underlying concept structure, this database may be particularly useful for testing constructive induction and structure discovery methods.\r\n", "purpose": null, "funded_by": null, "instances_represent": null, "recommended_data_splits": null, "sensitive_data": null, "preprocessing_description": null, "variable_info": "buying:   vhigh, high, med, low.\nmaint:    vhigh, high, med, low.\ndoors:    2, 3, 4, 5more.\npersons:  2, 4, more.\nlug_boot: small, med, big.\nsafety:   low, med, high.", "citation": null}, "n_target_levels": 4, "target_dtype": "object"}, "model_params": {"base_nn_hidden_size": 100, "base_nn_hidden_layers": 2, "base_nn_n_epochs": 100, "calibration_forecal_n_bins": 50, "calibration_forecal_n_samples": 100, "calibration_forecal_criterion": "friedman_mse", "calibration_forecal_weight": true, "calibration_forecal_n_estimators": 100, "calibration_histbin_bins": 20}}, {"dataset": "Adult", "results": [{"name": "baseline", "ece": 0.07912632994830818, "auc": 0.6900762459055779}, {"name": "forecal", "ece": 0.010054967705743385, "auc": 0.6885321141678362}, {"name": "isotonic", "ece": 0.005617279322479465, "auc": 0.6894643774173164}, {"name": "platt", "ece": 0.029439712225079347, "auc": 0.6900731232721777}, {"name": "tempscaler", "ece": 0.07189473273194637, "auc": 0.6900762459055779}, {"name": "hist-binning", "ece": 0.007619555045749116, "auc": 0.6860156488781908}, {"name": "bbq", "ece": 0.0069354549383628845, "auc": 0.6865377573741511}], "uri_id": 2, "dataset_meta": {"uci_id": 2, "name": "Adult", "repository_url": "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/2/adult", "data_url": "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/static/public/2/data.csv", "abstract": "Predict whether income exceeds $50K/yr based on census data.
