The age of abalone is determined by cutting the shell through the cone, staining it, and counting the number of rings through a microscope -- a boring and time-consuming task.  Other measurements, which are easier to obtain, are used to predict the age.  Further information, such as weather patterns and location (hence food availability) may be required to solve the problem.\r\n\r\nFrom the original data examples with missing values were removed (the majority having the predicted value missing), and the ranges of the continuous values have been scaled for use with an ANN (by dividing by 200).",

The second rating corresponds to the degree to which the auto is more risky than its price indicates. Cars are initially assigned a risk factor symbol associated with its price.   Then, if it is more risky (or less), this symbol is adjusted by moving it up (or down) the scale.  Actuarians call this process \"symboling\".  A value of +3 indicates that the auto is risky, -3 that it is probably pretty safe.\r\n\r\nThe third factor is the relative average loss payment per insured vehicle year.  This value is normalized for all autos within a particular size classification (two-door small, station wagons, sports/speciality, etc...), and represents the average loss per car per year.\r\n\r\nNote: Several of the attributes in the database could be used as a \"class\" attribute.",

      "summary": "An Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) or relational learning framework is assumed (Muggleton, 1992). The learning system is provided with examples of chess positions described only by the coordinates of the pieces on the board. Background knowledge in the form of row and column differences is also supplied. The relations necessary to form a correct and concise classifier for the target concept must be discovered by the learning system (the examples already provide a complete extensional definition). The task is closely related to Quinlan's (1983) application of ID3 to classify White King and Rook against Black King and Knight (KRKN) positions as lost 2-ply or lost 3-ply. The framework is similar in that the example positions supply only low-grade data. An important difference is that additional background predicates of the kind supplied in the KRKN study via hand-crafted attributes are not provided for this KRK domain.\r\n\r\nChess endgames are complex domains which are enumerable. Endgame databases are tables of stored game-theoretic values for the enumerated elements (legal positions) of the domain. The game-theoretic values stored denote whether or not positions are won for either side, or include also the depth of win (number of moves) assuming minimax-optimal play. From the point of view of experiments on computer induction such databases provide not only a source of examples but also an oracle (Roycroft, 1986) for testing induced rules. However a chess endgame database differs from, say, a relational database containing details of parts and suppliers in the following important respect. The combinatorics of computing the required game-theoretic values for individual position entries independently would be prohibitive. Therefore all the database entries are generated in a single iterative process using the ``standard backup'' algorithm (Thompson, 1986).\r\n\r\nA KRK database was described by Clarke (1977). The current database was described and used for machine learning experiments in Bain (1992; 1994). It should be noted that our database is not guaranteed correct, but the class distribution is the same as Clarke's database. In (Bain 1992; 1994) the task was classification of positions in the database as won for white in a fixed number of moves, assuming optimal play by both sides. The problem was structured into separate sub-problems by depth-of-win ordered draw, zero, one, ..., sixteen. When learning depth d all examples at depths > d are used as negatives. Quinlan (1994) applied Foil to learn a complete and correct solution for this task.\r\n\r\nThe typical complexity of induced classifiers in this domain suggest that the task is demanding when background knowledge is restricted.",

The actual forest cover type for a given observation (30 x 30 meter cell) was determined from US Forest Service (USFS) Region 2 Resource Information System (RIS) data.  Independent variables were derived from data originally obtained from US Geological Survey (USGS) and USFS data.  Data is in raw form (not scaled) and contains binary (0 or 1) columns of data for qualitative independent variables (wilderness areas and soil types).\r\n\r\nThis study area includes four wilderness areas located in the Roosevelt National Forest of northern Colorado.  These areas represent forests with minimal human-caused disturbances, so that existing forest cover types are more a result of ecological processes rather than forest management practices.\r\n\r\nSome background information for these four wilderness areas: Neota (area 2) probably has the highest mean elevational value of the 4 wilderness areas. Rawah (area 1) and Comanche Peak (area 3) would have a lower mean elevational value, while Cache la Poudre (area 4) would have the lowest mean elevational value. \r\n\r\nAs for primary major tree species in these areas, Neota would have spruce/fir (type 1), while Rawah and Comanche Peak would probably have lodgepole pine (type 2) as their primary species, followed by spruce/fir and aspen (type 5). Cache la Poudre would tend to have Ponderosa pine (type 3), Douglas-fir (type 6), and cottonwood/willow (type 4).  \r\n\r\nThe Rawah and Comanche Peak areas would tend to be more typical of the overall dataset than either the Neota or Cache la Poudre, due to their assortment of tree species and range of predictive variable values (elevation, etc.)  Cache la Poudre would probably  be more unique than the others, due to its relatively low  elevation range and species composition.

Recently, process delays known as cylinder banding in rotogravure printing were substantially mitigated using control rules discovered by decision tree induction. Our work exemplifies a more general methodology which transforms the knowledge acquisition task from one in which rules are directly elicited from an expert, to one in which a learning system is responsible for rule generation. The primary responsibilities of the human expert are to evaluate the merits of generated rules, and to guide the acquisition and classification of data necessary for machine induction. These responsibilities require the expert to do what an expert does best: to exercise his or her expertise. This seems a more natural fit to an expert's capabilities than the requirements of traditional methodologies that experts explicitly enumerate the rules that they employ.",

They all share the clinical features of erythema and scaling, with very little differences. The diseases in this group are psoriasis, seboreic dermatitis, lichen planus, pityriasis rosea, cronic dermatitis, and pityriasis rubra pilaris. Usually a biopsy is necessary for the diagnosis but unfortunately these diseases share many histopathological features as well. Another difficulty for the differential diagnosis is that a disease may show the features of another disease at the beginning stage and may have the characteristic features at the following stages. Patients were first evaluated clinically with 12 features. Afterwards, skin samples were taken for the evaluation of 22 histopathological features. The values of the histopathological features are determined by an analysis of the samples under a microscope. \r\n\r\nIn the dataset constructed for this domain, the family history feature has the value 1 if any of these diseases has been observed in the family, and 0 otherwise. The age feature simply represents the age of the patient. Every other feature (clinical and histopathological) was given a degree in the range of 0 to 3. Here, 0 indicates that the feature was not present, 3 indicates the largest amount possible, and 1, 2 indicate the relative intermediate values.\r\n\r\nThe names and id numbers of the patients were recently removed from the database.",

I checked this with the donater, Bojan Cestnik, who replied:\r\n\r\n About the hepatitis database and BILIRUBIN problem I would like to say the following: BILIRUBIN is continuous attribute (= the number of it's \"values\" in the ASDOHEPA.DAT file is negative!!!); \"values\" are quoted because when speaking about the continuous attribute there is no such thing as all possible values. However, they represent so called \"boundary\" values; according to these \"boundary\" values the attribute can be discretized. At the same time, because of the continious attribute, one can perform some other test since the continuous information is preserved. I hope that these lines have at least roughly answered your question. ",

The dataset does not contain any variable representing presence or absence of a liver disorder. Researchers who wish to use this dataset as a classification benchmark should follow the method used in experiments by the donor (Forsyth & Rada, 1986, Machine learning: applications in expert systems and information retrieval) and others (e.g. Turney, 1995, Cost-sensitive classification: Empirical evaluation of a hybrid genetic decision tree induction algorithm), who used the 6th field (drinks), after dichotomising, as a dependent variable for classification.

The problem posed in this dataset is to recognize, given a sequence of DNA, the boundaries between exons (the parts of the DNA sequence retained after splicing) and introns (the parts of the DNA sequence that are spliced out). This problem consists of two subtasks: recognizing exon/intron boundaries (referred to as EI sites), and recognizing intron/exon boundaries (IE sites). (In the biological community, IE borders are referred to a ``acceptors'' while EI borders are referred to as ``donors''.)\r\n\r\nThis dataset has been developed to help evaluate a \"hybrid\" learning algorithm (KBANN) that uses examples to inductively refine preexisting knowledge.  Using a \"ten-fold cross-validation\" methodology on 1000 examples randomly selected from the complete set of 3190, the following  error rates were produced by various ML algorithms (all experiments run at the Univ of Wisconsin, sometimes with local implementations of published algorithms). \r\n\r\nSystem -- Neither -- EI -- IE\r\n---------------------------------------------------\r\nKBANN -- 4.62 -- 7.56 --  8.47\r\nBACKPROP -- 5.29 --  5.74 -- 10.75\r\nPEBLS -- 6.86 -- 8.18 -- 7.55\r\nPERCEPTRON -- 3.99 -- 16.32 -- 17.41\r\nID3 -- 8.84 -- 10.58 -- 13.99\r\nCOBWEB  -- 11.80 -- 15.04 -- 9.46\r\nNear.

Zhang has been published as Technical Report CS-CMU-91-197, Carnegie Mellon University in Dec. 1991.\r\n\r\nOne significant characteristic of this comparison is that it was performed by a collection of researchers, each of whom was an advocate of the technique they tested (often they were the creators of the various methods). In this sense, the results are less biased than in comparisons performed by a single person advocating a specific learning method, and more accurately reflect the generalization behavior of the learning techniques as applied by knowledgeable users.\r\n\r\nThere are three MONK's problems.  The domains for all MONK's problems are the same (described below).  One of the MONK's problems has noise added. For each problem, the domain has been partitioned into a train and test set.",

      "summary": "Nursery Database was derived from a hierarchical decision model originally developed to rank applications for nursery schools. It was used during several years in 1980's when there was excessive enrollment to these schools in Ljubljana, Slovenia, and the rejected applications frequently needed an objective explanation. The final decision depended on three subproblems: occupation of parents and child's nursery, family structure and financial standing, and social and health picture of the family. The model was developed within expert system shell for decision making DEX (M. Bohanec, V. Rajkovic: Expert system for decision making. Sistemica 1(1), pp. 145-157, 1990.).\r\n\r\nThe hierarchical model ranks nursery-school applications according to the following concept structure:\r\n\r\n NURSERY            Evaluation of applications for nursery schools\r\n . EMPLOY           Employment of parents and child's nursery\r\n . . parents        Parents' occupation\r\n . . has_nurs       Child's nursery\r\n . STRUCT_FINAN     Family structure and financial standings\r\n . . STRUCTURE      Family structure\r\n . . . form         Form of the family\r\n . . . children     Number of children\r\n . . housing        Housing conditions\r\n . . finance        Financial standing of the family\r\n . SOC_HEALTH       Social and health picture of the family\r\n . . social         Social conditions\r\n . . health         Health conditions\r\n\r\nInput attributes are printed in lowercase. Besides the target concept (NURSERY) the model includes four intermediate concepts: EMPLOY, STRUCT_FINAN, STRUCTURE, SOC_HEALTH. Every concept is in the original model related to its lower level descendants by a set of examples (for these examples sets see http://www-ai.ijs.si/BlazZupan/nursery.html).\r\n\r\nThe Nursery Database contains examples with the structural information removed, i.e., directly relates NURSERY to the eight input attributes: parents, has_nurs, form, children, housing, finance, social, health.\r\n\r\nBecause of known underlying concept structure, this database may be particularly useful for testing constructive induction and structure discovery methods.",

      "summary": "We create a digit database by collecting 250 samples from 44 writers. The samples written by 30 writers are used for training, cross-validation and writer dependent testing, and the digits written by the other 14 are used for writer independent testing. This database is also available in the UNIPEN format.\r\n\r\nWe use a WACOM PL-100V pressure sensitive tablet with an integrated LCD display and a cordless stylus. The input and display areas are located in the same place. Attached to the serial port of an Intel 486 based PC, it allows us to collect handwriting samples. The tablet sends $x$ and $y$ tablet coordinates and pressure level values of the pen at fixed time intervals (sampling rate) of 100 miliseconds. \r\n\r\nThese writers are asked to write 250 digits in random order inside boxes of 500 by 500 tablet pixel resolution.  Subject are monitored only during the first entry screens. Each screen contains five boxes with the digits to be written displayed above. Subjects are told to write only inside these boxes.  If they make a mistake or are unhappy with their writing, they are instructed to clear the content of a box by using an on-screen button. The first ten digits are ignored because most writers are not familiar with this type of input devices, but subjects are not aware of this. \r\n\r\nIn our study, we use only ($x, y$) coordinate information. The stylus pressure level values are ignored. First we apply normalization to make our representation invariant to translations and scale distortions. The raw data that we capture from the tablet consist of integer values between 0 and 500 (tablet input box resolution). The new coordinates are such that the coordinate which has the maximum range varies between 0 and 100. Usually $x$ stays in this range, since most characters are taller than they are wide.  \r\n\r\nIn order to train and test our classifiers, we need to represent digits as constant length feature vectors. A commonly used technique leading to good results is resampling the ( x_t, y_t) points. Temporal resampling (points regularly spaced in time) or spatial resampling (points regularly spaced in arc length) can be used here. Raw point data are already regularly spaced in time but the distance between them is variable. Previous research showed that spatial resampling to obtain a constant number of regularly spaced points on the trajectory yields much better performance, because it provides a better alignment between points. Our resampling algorithm uses simple linear interpolation between pairs of points. The resampled digits are represented as a sequence of T points ( x_t, y_t )_{t=1}^T, regularly spaced in arc length, as opposed to the input sequence, which is regularly spaced in time.\r\n\r\nSo, the input vector size is 2*T, two times the number of points resampled. We considered spatial resampling to T=8,12,16 points in our experiments and found that T=8 gave the best trade-off between accuracy and complexity.",

Primary o-ring erosion only\r\n\r\nThe two databases are identical except for the 2nd attribute of the 21st instance (confirmed by David Draper on 8/5/93).\r\n\r\nEdited from (Draper, 1993):\r\n\r\nThe motivation for collecting this database was the explosion of the USA Space Shuttle Challenger on 28 January, 1986.  An investigation ensued into the reliability of the shuttle's propulsion system.  The explosion was eventually traced to the failure of one of the three field joints on one of the two solid booster rockets.  Each of these six field joints includes two O-rings, designated as primary and secondary, which fail when phenomena called erosion and blowby both occur. \r\n\r\nThe night before the launch a decision had to be made regarding launch safety.  The discussion among engineers and managers leading to this decision included concern that the probability of failure of the O-rings depended on the temperature t at launch, which was forecase to be 31 degrees F. There are strong engineering reasons based on the composition of O-rings to support the judgment that failure probability may rise monotonically as temperature drops.  One other variable, the pressure s at which safety testing for field join leaks was performed, was available, but its relevance to the failure process was unclear.\r\n       \r\nDraper's paper includes a menacing figure graphing the number of field joints experiencing stress vs. liftoff temperature for the 23 shuttle flights previous to the Challenger disaster.  No previous liftoff temperature was under 53 degrees F.  Although tremendous extrapolation must be done from the given data to assess risk at 31 degrees F, it is obvious even to the layman \"to foresee the unacceptably high risk created by launching at 31 degrees F.\"  For more information, see Draper (1993) or the other previous analyses.\r\n       \r\nThe task is to predict the number of O-rings that will experience thermal distress for a given flight when the launch temperature is below freezing.",

Our collection of non-spam e-mails came from filed work and personal e-mails, and hence the word 'george' and the area code '650' are indicators of non-spam.  These are useful when constructing a personalized spam filter.

      "summary": "The database consists of the multi-spectral values of pixels in 3x3 neighbourhoods in a satellite image, and the classification associated with the central pixel in each neighbourhood. The aim is to predict this classification, given the multi-spectral values. In the sample database, the class of a pixel is coded as a number.\r\n\r\nThe Landsat satellite data is one of the many sources of information available for a scene. The interpretation of a scene by integrating spatial data of diverse types and resolutions including multispectral and radar data, maps indicating topography, land use etc. is expected to assume significant importance with the onset of an era characterised by integrative approaches to remote sensing (for example, NASA's Earth Observing System commencing this decade). Existing statistical methods are ill-equipped for handling such diverse data types. Note that this is not true for Landsat MSS data considered in isolation (as in this sample database). This data satisfies the important requirements of being numerical and at a single resolution, and standard maximum-likelihood classification performs very well. Consequently, for this data, it should be interesting to compare the performance of other methods against the statistical approach.\r\n\r\nOne frame of Landsat MSS imagery consists of four digital images of the same scene in different spectral bands. Two of these are in the visible region (corresponding approximately to green and red regions of the visible spectrum) and two are in the (near) infra-red. Each pixel is a 8-bit binary word, with 0 corresponding to black and 255 to white. The spatial resolution of a pixel is about 80m x 80m. Each image contains 2340 x 3380 such pixels.\r\n\r\nThe database is a (tiny) sub-area of a scene, consisting of 82 x 100 pixels. Each line of data corresponds to a 3x3 square neighbourhood of pixels completely contained within the 82x100 sub-area. Each line contains the pixel values in the four spectral bands (converted to ASCII) of each of the 9 pixels in the 3x3 neighbourhood and a number indicating the classification label of the central pixel. The number is a code for the following classes:\r\n\r\nNumber\t\t\tClass\r\n1\t\t\tred soil\r\n2\t\t\tcotton crop\r\n3\t\t\tgrey soil\r\n4\t\t\tdamp grey soil\r\n5\t\t\tsoil with vegetation stubble\r\n6\t\t\tmixture class (all types present)\r\n7\t\t\tvery damp grey soil\r\n\t\r\nNB. There are no examples with class 6 in this dataset.\r\n\r\nThe data is given in random order and certain lines of data have been removed so you cannot reconstruct the original image from this dataset.\r\n\r\nIn each line of data the four spectral values for the top-left pixel are given first followed by the four spectral values for the top-middle pixel and then those for the top-right pixel, and so on with the pixels read out in sequence left-to-right and top-to-bottom. Thus, the four spectral values for the central pixel are given by attributes 17,18,19 and 20. If you like you can use only these four attributes, while ignoring the others. This avoids the problem which arises when a 3x3 neighbourhood straddles a boundary.\r\n",

      "summary": "The purpose is to classify a given silhouette as one of four types of vehicle, using  a set of features extracted from the silhouette. The vehicle may be viewed from one of many different angles.  \r\n\r\nHISTORY:\r\n\r\nThis data was originally gathered at the TI in 1986-87 by JP Siebert. It was partially financed by Barr and Stroud Ltd. The original purpose was to find a method of distinguishing 3D objects within a 2D image by application of an ensemble of shape feature extractors to the 2D silhouettes of the objects. Measures of shape features extracted from example silhouettes of objects to be discriminated were used to generate a classification rule tree by means of computer induction.\r\n\r\nThis object recognition strategy was successfully used to discriminate between silhouettes of model cars, vans and buses viewed from constrained elevation but all angles of rotation.\r\n\r\nThe rule tree classification performance compared favourably to MDC (Minimum Distance Classifier) and k-NN (k-Nearest Neighbour) statistical classifiers in terms of both error rate and computational efficiency. An investigation of these rule trees generated by example indicated that the tree structure was heavily influenced by the orientation of the objects, and grouped similar object views into single decisions.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION:\r\n\r\nThe features were extracted from the silhouettes by the HIPS (Hierarchical Image Processing System) extension BINATTS, which extracts a combination of scale independent features utilising both classical moments based measures such as scaled variance, skewness and kurtosis about the major/minor axes and heuristic measures such as hollows, circularity, rectangularity and compactness.\r\n\r\nFour \"Corgie\" model vehicles were used for the experiment: a double decker bus, Cheverolet van, Saab 9000 and an Opel Manta 400. This particular combination of vehicles was chosen with the expectation that the bus, van and either one of the cars would be readily distinguishable, but it would be more difficult to distinguish between the cars.\r\n\r\nThe images were acquired by a camera looking downwards at the model vehicle from a fixed angle of elevation (34.2 degrees to the horizontal). The vehicles were placed on a diffuse backlit surface (lightbox). The vehicles were painted matte black to minimise highlights. The images were captured using a CRS4000 framestore connected to a vax 750. All images were captured with a spatial resolution of 128x128 pixels quantised to 64 greylevels. These images were thresholded to produce binary vehicle silhouettes, negated (to comply with the processing requirements of BINATTS) and thereafter subjected to shrink-expand-expand-shrink HIPS modules to remove \"salt and pepper\" image noise.\r\n\r\nThe vehicles were rotated and their angle of orientation was measured using a radial graticule beneath the vehicle. 0 and 180 degrees corresponded to \"head on\" and \"rear\" views respectively while 90 and 270 corresponded to profiles in opposite directions. Two sets of 60 images, each set covering a full 360 degree rotation, were captured for each vehicle. The vehicle was rotated by a fixed angle between images. These datasets are known as e2 and e3 respectively.\r\n\r\n A further two sets of images, e4 and e5, were captured with the camera at elevations of 37.5 degs and 30.8 degs respectively. These sets also contain 60 images per vehicle apart from e4.van which contains only 46 owing to the difficulty of containing the van in the image at some orientations.\r\n",

      "summary": "The data are MC generated (see below) to simulate registration of high energy gamma particles in a ground-based atmospheric Cherenkov gamma telescope using the imaging technique. Cherenkov gamma telescope observes high energy gamma rays, taking advantage of the radiation emitted by charged particles produced inside the electromagnetic showers initiated by the gammas, and developing in the atmosphere. This Cherenkov radiation (of visible to UV wavelengths) leaks through the atmosphere and gets recorded in the detector, allowing reconstruction of the shower parameters. The available information consists of pulses left by the incoming Cherenkov photons on the photomultiplier tubes, arranged in a plane, the camera. Depending on the energy of the primary gamma, a total of few hundreds to some 10000 Cherenkov photons get collected, in patterns (called the shower image), allowing to discriminate statistically those caused by primary gammas (signal) from the images of hadronic showers initiated by cosmic rays in the upper atmosphere (background).\r\n\r\nTypically, the image of a shower after some pre-processing is an elongated cluster. Its long axis is oriented towards the camera center if the shower axis is parallel to the telescope's optical axis, i.e. if the telescope axis is directed towards a point source. A principal component analysis is performed in the camera plane, which results in a correlation axis and defines an ellipse. If the depositions were distributed as a bivariate Gaussian, this would be an equidensity ellipse. The characteristic parameters of this ellipse (often called Hillas parameters) are among the image parameters that can be used for discrimination. The energy depositions are typically asymmetric along the major axis, and this asymmetry can also be used in discrimination. There are, in addition, further discriminating characteristics, like the extent of the cluster in the image plane, or the total sum of depositions.\r\n\r\nThe data set was generated by a Monte Carlo program, Corsika, described in:\r\n    D. Heck et al., CORSIKA, A Monte Carlo code to simulate extensive air showers,\r\n    Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe FZKA 6019 (1998).\r\nhttp://rexa.info/paper?id=ac6e674e9af20979b23d3ed4521f1570765e8d68\r\n\r\nThe program was run with parameters allowing to observe events with energies down to below 50 GeV.",

A Gaussian support vector machine (SVM) fed\r\n   with only 4 direct weather conditions (temp, RH, wind and rain) obtained the best MAD value:\r\n   12.71 +- 0.01 (mean and confidence interval within 95% using a t-student distribution). The\r\n   best RMSE was attained by the naive mean predictor. An analysis to the regression error curve\r\n   (REC) shows that the SVM model predicts more examples within a lower admitted error.

      "summary": "  Many variables are included so that algorithms that select or learn weights for attributes could be tested. However, clearly unrelated attributes were not included; attributes were picked if there was any plausible connection to crime (N=122), plus the attribute to be predicted (Per Capita Violent Crimes). The variables included in the dataset involve the community, such as the percent of the population considered urban, and the median family income, and involving law enforcement, such as per capita number of police officers, and percent of officers assigned to drug units. \r\n \r\n The per capita violent crimes variable was calculated using population and the sum of crime variables considered violent crimes in the United States: murder, rape, robbery, and assault. There was apparently some controversy in some states concerning the counting of rapes. These resulted in missing values for rape, which resulted in incorrect values for per capita violent crime. These cities are not included in the dataset. Many of these omitted communities were from the midwestern USA.\r\n\r\n  Data is described below based on original values. All numeric data was normalized into the decimal range  0.00-1.00 using an Unsupervised, equal-interval binning method. Attributes retain their distribution and skew (hence for example the population attribute has a mean value of  0.06 because most communities are small). E.g. An attribute described as 'mean people per household' is actually the normalized (0-1) version of that value.\r\n\r\n  The normalization preserves rough ratios of values WITHIN an attribute (e.g. double the value for double the population within the available precision - except for extreme values (all values more than 3 SD above the mean are normalized to 1.00; all values more than 3 SD below the mean are nromalized to  0.00)).\r\n\r\n  However, the normalization does not preserve relationships between values BETWEEN attributes (e.g. it would not be meaningful to compare the value for whitePerCap with the value for blackPerCap for a community)\r\n\r\n  A limitation was that the LEMAS survey was of the police departments with at least 100 officers, plus a random sample of smaller departments. For our purposes, communities not found in both census and crime datasets were omitted. Many communities are missing LEMAS data.\r\n\r\n.arff header for Weka:\r\n\r\n@relation crimepredict\r\n\r\n@attribute state numeric\r\n@attribute county numeric\r\n@attribute community numeric\r\n@attribute communityname string\r\n@attribute fold numeric\r\n@attribute population numeric\r\n@attribute householdsize numeric\r\n@attribute racepctblack numeric\r\n@attribute racePctWhite numeric\r\n@attribute racePctAsian numeric\r\n@attribute racePctHisp numeric\r\n@attribute agePct12t21 numeric\r\n@attribute agePct12t29 numeric\r\n@attribute agePct16t24 numeric\r\n@attribute agePct65up numeric\r\n@attribute numbUrban numeric\r\n@attribute pctUrban numeric\r\n@attribute medIncome numeric\r\n@attribute pctWWage numeric\r\n@attribute pctWFarmSelf numeric\r\n@attribute pctWInvInc numeric\r\n@attribute pctWSocSec numeric\r\n@attribute pctWPubAsst numeric\r\n@attribute pctWRetire numeric\r\n@attribute medFamInc numeric\r\n@attribute perCapInc numeric\r\n@attribute whitePerCap numeric\r\n@attribute blackPerCap numeric\r\n@attribute indianPerCap numeric\r\n@attribute AsianPerCap numeric\r\n@attribute OtherPerCap numeric\r\n@attribute HispPerCap numeric\r\n@attribute NumUnderPov numeric\r\n@attribute PctPopUnderPov numeric\r\n@attribute PctLess9thGrade numeric\r\n@attribute PctNotHSGrad numeric\r\n@attribute PctBSorMore numeric\r\n@attribute PctUnemployed numeric\r\n@attribute PctEmploy numeric\r\n@attribute PctEmplManu numeric\r\n@attribute PctEmplProfServ numeric\r\n@attribute PctOccupManu numeric\r\n@attribute PctOccupMgmtProf numeric\r\n@attribute MalePctDivorce numeric\r\n@attribute MalePctNevMarr numeric\r\n@attribute FemalePctDiv numeric\r\n@attribute TotalPctDiv numeric\r\n@attribute PersPerFam numeric\r\n@attribute PctFam2Par numeric\r\n@attribute PctKids2Par numeric\r\n@attribute PctYoungKids2Par numeric\r\n@attribute PctTeen2Par numeric\r\n@attribute PctWorkMomYoungKids numeric\r\n@attribute PctWorkMom numeric\r\n@attribute NumIlleg numeric\r\n@attribute PctIlleg numeric\r\n@attribute NumImmig numeric\r\n@attribute PctImmigRecent numeric\r\n@attribute PctImmigRec5 numeric\r\n@attribute PctImmigRec8 numeric\r\n@attribute PctImmigRec10 numeric\r\n@attribute PctRecentImmig numeric\r\n@attribute PctRecImmig5 numeric\r\n@attribute PctRecImmig8 numeric\r\n@attribute PctRecImmig10 numeric\r\n@attribute PctSpeakEnglOnly numeric\r\n@attribute PctNotSpeakEnglWell numeric\r\n@attribute PctLargHouseFam numeric\r\n@attribute PctLargHouseOccup numeric\r\n@attribute PersPerOccupHous numeric\r\n@attribute PersPerOwnOccHous numeric\r\n@attribute PersPerRentOccHous numeric\r\n@attribute PctPersOwnOccup numeric\r\n@attribute PctPersDenseHous numeric\r\n@attribute PctHousLess3BR numeric\r\n@attribute MedNumBR numeric\r\n@attribute HousVacant numeric\r\n@attribute PctHousOccup numeric\r\n@attribute PctHousOwnOcc numeric\r\n@attribute PctVacantBoarded numeric\r\n@attribute PctVacMore6Mos numeric\r\n@attribute MedYrHousBuilt numeric\r\n@attribute PctHousNoPhone numeric\r\n@attribute PctWOFullPlumb numeric\r\n@attribute OwnOccLowQuart numeric\r\n@attribute OwnOccMedVal numeric\r\n@attribute OwnOccHiQuart numeric\r\n@attribute RentLowQ numeric\r\n@attribute RentMedian numeric\r\n@attribute RentHighQ numeric\r\n@attribute MedRent numeric\r\n@attribute MedRentPctHousInc numeric\r\n@attribute MedOwnCostPctInc numeric\r\n@attribute MedOwnCostPctIncNoMtg numeric\r\n@attribute NumInShelters numeric\r\n@attribute NumStreet numeric\r\n@attribute PctForeignBorn numeric\r\n@attribute PctBornSameState numeric\r\n@attribute PctSameHouse85 numeric\r\n@attribute PctSameCity85 numeric\r\n@attribute PctSameState85 numeric\r\n@attribute LemasSwornFT numeric\r\n@attribute LemasSwFTPerPop numeric\r\n@attribute LemasSwFTFieldOps numeric\r\n@attribute LemasSwFTFieldPerPop numeric\r\n@attribute LemasTotalReq numeric\r\n@attribute LemasTotReqPerPop numeric\r\n@attribute PolicReqPerOffic numeric\r\n@attribute PolicPerPop numeric\r\n@attribute RacialMatchCommPol numeric\r\n@attribute PctPolicWhite numeric\r\n@attribute PctPolicBlack numeric\r\n@attribute PctPolicHisp numeric\r\n@attribute PctPolicAsian numeric\r\n@attribute PctPolicMinor numeric\r\n@attribute OfficAssgnDrugUnits numeric\r\n@attribute NumKindsDrugsSeiz numeric\r\n@attribute PolicAveOTWorked numeric\r\n@attribute LandArea numeric\r\n@attribute PopDens numeric\r\n@attribute PctUsePubTrans numeric\r\n@attribute PolicCars numeric\r\n@attribute PolicOperBudg numeric\r\n@attribute LemasPctPolicOnPatr numeric\r\n@attribute LemasGangUnitDeploy numeric\r\n@attribute LemasPctOfficDrugUn numeric\r\n@attribute PolicBudgPerPop numeric\r\n@attribute ViolentCrimesPerPop numeric\r\n\r\n@data\r\n\r\n  ",

Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.).\n\nThese datasets can be viewed as classification or regression tasks.  The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are many more normal wines than excellent or poor ones). Outlier detection algorithms could be used to detect the few excellent or poor wines. Also, we are not sure if all input variables are relevant. So it could be interesting to test feature selection methods.\n",

The recordings were automatically captured in the patient's homes.\r\n\r\nColumns in the table contain subject number, subject age, subject gender, time interval from baseline recruitment date, motor UPDRS, total UPDRS, and 16 biomedical voice measures. Each row corresponds to one of 5,875 voice recording from these individuals. The main aim of the data is to predict the motor and total UPDRS scores ('motor_UPDRS' and 'total_UPDRS') from the 16 voice measures.\r\n\r\nThe data is in ASCII CSV format. The rows of the CSV file contain an instance corresponding to one voice recording. There are around 200 recordings per patient, the subject number of the patient is identified in the first column.

      "summary": "Bike sharing systems are new generation of traditional bike rentals where whole process from membership, rental and return back has become automatic. Through these systems, user is able to easily rent a bike from a particular position and return back at another position. Currently, there are about over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world which is composed of over 500 thousands bicycles. Today, there exists great interest in these systems due to their important role in traffic, environmental and health issues. \r\n\r\nApart from interesting real world applications of bike sharing systems, the characteristics of data being generated by these systems make them attractive for the research. Opposed to other transport services such as bus or subway, the duration of travel, departure and arrival position is explicitly recorded in these systems. This feature turns bike sharing system into a virtual sensor network that can be used for sensing mobility in the city. Hence, it is expected that most of important events in the city could be detected via monitoring these data.",

Each row concerns hospital records of patients diagnosed with diabetes, who underwent laboratory, medications, and stayed up to 14 days. The goal is to determine the early readmission of the patient within 30 days of discharge.\nThe problem is important for the following reasons. Despite high-quality evidence showing improved clinical outcomes for diabetic patients who receive various preventive and therapeutic interventions, many patients do not receive them. This can be partially attributed to arbitrary diabetes management in hospital environments, which fail to attend to glycemic control. Failure to provide proper diabetes care not only increases the managing costs for the hospitals (as the patients are readmitted) but also impacts the morbidity and mortality of the patients, who may face complications associated with diabetes.\n",

      "summary": "In predicting stock prices you collect data over some period of time - day, week, month, etc. But you cannot take advantage of data from a time period until the next increment of the time period. For example, assume you collect data daily.  When Monday is over you have all of the data for that day.  However you can invest on Monday, because you don't get the data until the end of the day.  You can use the data from Monday to invest on Tuesday.  \r\n\r\nIn our research each record (row) is data for a week.  Each record also has the percentage of return that stock has in the following week (percent_change_next_weeks_price). Ideally, you want to determine which stock will produce the greatest rate of return in the following week.  This can help you train and test your algorithm.\r\n\r\nSome of these attributes might not be use used in your research.  They were originally added to our database to perform calculations.  (Brown, Pelosi & Dirska, 2013) used percent_change_price, percent_change_volume_over_last_wk, days_to_next_dividend, and percent_return_next_dividend.  We left the other attributes in the dataset\tin case you wanted to use any of them. Of course what you want to maximize is percent_change_next_weeks_price.\r\n\r\nTraining data vs Test data:\r\nIn (Brown, Pelosi & Dirska, 2013) we used quarter 1 (Jan-Mar) data for training and quarter 2 (Apr-Jun) data for testing. \r\n\r\nInteresting data points:\r\nIf you use quarter 2 data for testing, you will notice something interesting in the week ending 5/27/2011 every Dow Jones Index stock lost money.",

In [Cortez and Silva, 2008], the two datasets were modeled under binary/five-level classification and regression tasks. Important note: the target attribute G3 has a strong correlation with attributes G2 and G1. This occurs because G3 is the final year grade (issued at the 3rd period), while G1 and G2 correspond to the 1st and 2nd period grades. It is more difficult to predict G3 without G2 and G1, but such prediction is much more useful (see paper source for more details).",

From the perspective of risk management, the result of predictive accuracy of the estimated probability of default will be more valuable than the binary result of classification - credible or not credible clients. Because the real probability of default is unknown, this study presented the novel Sorting Smoothing Method to estimate the real probability of default. With the real probability of default as the response variable (Y), and the predictive probability of default as the independent variable (X), the simple linear regression result (Y = A + BX) shows that the forecasting model produced by artificial neural network has the highest coefficient of determination; its regression intercept (A) is close to zero, and regression coefficient (B) to one. Therefore, among the six data mining techniques, artificial neural network is the only one that can accurately estimate the real probability of default.",

      "summary": "HTRU2 is a data set which describes a sample of pulsar candidates collected during the High Time Resolution Universe Survey (South) [1]. \r\n\r\nPulsars are a rare type of Neutron star that produce radio emission detectable here on Earth. They are of considerable scientific interest as probes of space-time, the inter-stellar medium, and states of matter (see [2] for more uses). \r\n\r\nAs pulsars rotate, their emission beam sweeps across the sky, and when this crosses our line of sight, produces a detectable pattern of broadband radio emission. As pulsars\r\nrotate rapidly, this pattern repeats periodically. Thus pulsar search involves looking for periodic radio signals with large radio telescopes.\r\n\r\nEach pulsar produces a slightly different emission pattern, which varies slightly with each rotation (see [2] for an introduction to pulsar astrophysics to find out why). Thus a  potential signal detection known as a 'candidate', is averaged over many rotations of the pulsar, as determined by the length of an observation. In the absence of additional info, each candidate could potentially describe a real pulsar. However in practice almost all detections are caused by radio frequency interference (RFI) and noise, making legitimate signals hard to find.\r\n\r\nMachine learning tools are now being used to automatically label pulsar candidates to facilitate rapid analysis. Classification systems in particular are being widely adopted,\r\n(see [4,5,6,7,8,9]) which treat the candidate data sets  as binary classification problems. Here the legitimate pulsar examples are a minority positive class, and spurious examples the majority negative class. At present multi-class labels are unavailable, given the costs associated with data annotation.\r\n\r\nThe data set shared here contains 16,259 spurious examples caused by RFI/noise, and 1,639 real pulsar examples. These examples have all been checked by human annotators. \r\n\r\nThe data is presented in two formats: CSV and ARFF (used by the WEKA data mining tool). Candidates are stored in both files in separate rows. Each row lists the variables first, and the class label is the final entry. The class labels used are 0 (negative) and 1 (positive).\r\n\r\nPlease note that the data contains no positional information or other astronomical details. It is simply feature data extracted from candidate files using the PulsarFeatureLab tool (see [10]).",

All input attributes are originally categorical and are quantified. After quantification values of all input features can be considered as real-valued. In addition, participants were questioned concerning their use of 18 legal and illegal drugs (alcohol, amphetamines, amyl nitrite, benzodiazepine, cannabis, chocolate, cocaine, caffeine, crack, ecstasy, heroin, ketamine, legal highs, LSD, methadone, mushrooms, nicotine and volatile substance abuse and one fictitious drug (Semeron) which was introduced to identify over-claimers. For each drug they have to select one of the answers: never used the drug, used it over a decade ago, or in the last decade, year, month, week, or day.\nDatabase contains 18 classification problems. Each of independent label variables contains seven classes: \"Never Used\", \"Used over a Decade Ago\", \"Used in Last Decade\", \"Used in Last Year\", \"Used in Last Month\", \"Used in Last Week\", and \"Used in Last Day\".\n\nProblem which can be solved:\n* Seven class classifications for each drug separately.\n* Problem can be transformed to binary classification by union of part of classes into one new class. For example, \"Never Used\", \"Used over a Decade Ago\" form class \"Non-user\" and all other classes form class \"User\".\n* The best binarization of classes for each attribute.\n* Evaluation of risk to be drug consumer for each drug.\n\nDetailed description of database and process of data quantification are presented in E.

      "summary": "The data set is at 10 min for about 4.5 months. The house temperature and humidity conditions were monitored with a ZigBee wireless sensor network. Each wireless node transmitted the temperature and humidity conditions around 3.3 min. Then, the wireless data was averaged for 10 minutes periods. The energy data was logged every 10 minutes with m-bus energy meters. Weather from the nearest airport weather station (Chievres Airport, Belgium) was downloaded from a public data set from Reliable Prognosis (rp5.ru), and merged together with the experimental data sets using the date and time column. Two random variables have been included in the data set for testing the regression models and to filter out non predictive attributes (parameters).\r\n\r\nFor more information about the house, data collection, R scripts and figures, please refer to the paper and to the following github repository:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/LuisM78/Appliances-energy-prediction-data\r\n",

The legitimate websites were collected from Yahoo and starting point directories using a web script developed in PHP. The PHP script was plugged with a browser and we collected 548 legitimate websites out of 1353 websites. There is 702 phishing URLs, and 103 suspicious URLs.  \n\nWhen a website is considered SUSPICIOUS that means it can be either phishy or legitimate, meaning the website held some legit and phishy features.

      "summary": "There are three disadvantages of weighted scoring stock selection models. First, they cannot identify the relations between weights of stock-picking concepts and performances of portfolios. Second, they cannot systematically discover the optimal combination for weights of concepts to optimize the performances. Third, they are unable to meet various investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 preferences. This study aims to more efficiently construct weighted scoring stock selection models to overcome these disadvantages. Since the weights of stock-picking concepts in a weighted scoring stock selection model can be regarded as components in a mixture, we used the simplex centroid mixture design to obtain the experimental sets of weights. These sets of weights are simulated with US stock market historical data to obtain their performances. Performance prediction models were built with the simulated performance data set and artificial neural networks. Furthermore, the optimization models to reflect investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 preferences were built up, and the performance prediction models were employed as the kernel of the optimization models so that the optimal solutions can now be solved with optimization techniques. The empirical values of the performances of the optimal weighting combinations generated by the optimization models showed that they can meet various investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 preferences and outperform those of S&P\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 500 not only during the training period but also during the testing period.",

The values of these features are derived from the URL information of the pages visited by the user and updated in real time when a user takes an action, e.g. moving from one page to another. The \"Bounce Rate\", \"Exit Rate\" and \"Page Value\" features represent the metrics measured by \"Google Analytics\" for each page in the e-commerce site. The value of \"Bounce Rate\" feature for a web page refers to the percentage of visitors who enter the site from that page and then leave (\"bounce\") without triggering any other requests to the analytics server during that session. The value of \"Exit Rate\" feature for a specific web page is calculated as for all pageviews to the page, the percentage that were the last in the session. The \"Page Value\" feature represents the average value for a web page that a user visited before completing an e-commerce transaction. The \"Special Day\" feature indicates the closeness of the site visiting time to a specific special day (e.g. Mother\u2019s Day, Valentine's Day) in which the sessions are more likely to be finalized with transaction. The value of this attribute is determined by considering the dynamics of e-commerce such as the duration between the order date and delivery date. For example, for Valentina\u2019s day, this value takes a nonzero value between February 2 and February 12, zero before and after this date unless it is close to another special day, and its maximum value of 1 on February 8. The dataset also includes operating system, browser, region, traffic type, visitor type as returning or new visitor, a Boolean value indicating whether the date of the visit is weekend, and month of the year.",

All patients were subject to the unmanipulated allogeneic unrelated donor hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. \r\n \r\nThe motivation of the study was to identify the most important factors influencing the success or failure of the transplantation procedure. In particular, the aim was to verify the hypothesis that increased dosage of CD34+ cells / kg extends overall survival time without simultaneous occurrence of undesirable events affecting patients' quality of life (Kaw\u00c5\u201aak et al., 2010).\r\n\r\nThe data set has been used in our work concerning survival rules (Wr\u00c3\u00b3bel et al., 2017) and user-guided rule induction (Sikora et al., 2019). The authors of the research on stem cell transplantation (Kaw\u00c5\u201aak et al., 2010) who inspired our study also contributed to the set.",

      "summary": "Problems of real-life complexity are needed to test and compare various data mining and pattern recognition methods. The proposed database can be used to solve two practically important problems: predicting complications of Myocardial Infarction (MI) based on information about the patient (i) at the time of admission and (ii) on the third day of the hospital period. Another important group of tasks is phenotyping of disease (cluster analysis), dynamic phenotyping (filament extraction and identification of disease trajectories) and visualisation (disease mapping). \r\nMI is one of the most challenging problems of modern medicine. Acute myocardial infarction is associated with high mortality in the first year after it. The incidence of MI remains high in all countries. This is especially true for the urban population of highly developed countries, which is exposed to chronic stress factors, irregular and not always balanced nutrition. In the United States, for example, more than a million people suffer from MI every year, and 200-300 thousand of them die from acute MI before arriving at the hospital. \r\nThe course of the disease in patients with MI is different. MI can occur without complications or with complications that do not worsen the long-term prognosis. At the same time, about half of patients in the acute and subacute periods have complications that lead to worsening of the disease and even death. Even an experienced specialist can not always foresee the development of these complications. In this regard, predicting complications of myocardial infarction in order to timely carry out the necessary preventive measures is an important task. \r\n\r\nProblems to solve\r\nIn general columns 2-112 can be used as input data for prediction. Possible complications (outputs) are listed in columns 113-124.\r\nThere are four possible time moments for complication prediction: on base of the information known at\r\n1.\tthe time of admission to hospital: all input columns (2-112) except 93, 94, 95, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105 can be used for prediction;\r\n2.\tthe end of the first day (24 hours after admission to the hospital): all input columns (2-112) except 94, 95, 101, 102, 104, 105 can be used for prediction;\r\n3.\tthe end of the second day (48 hours after admission to the hospital) all input columns (2-112) except 95, 102, 105 can be used for prediction;\r\n4.\tthe end of the third day (72 hours after admission to the hospital) all input columns (2-112) can be used for prediction.\r\n\r\nYou can find detailed description of database, descriptive statistics and csv version of database in DOI: 10.25392/leicester.data.12045261.v3\r\n",

Satisfying the huge global demand for garment products is mostly dependent on the production and delivery performance of the employees in the garment manufacturing companies. So, it is highly desirable among the decision makers in the garments industry to track, analyse and predict the productivity performance of the working teams in their factories. This dataset can be used for regression purpose by predicting the productivity range (0-1) or for classification purpose by transforming the productivity range (0-1) into different classes.",

At this point in time, the tool is replaced 69 times, and fails 51 times (randomly assigned).\r\nheat dissipation failure (HDF): heat dissipation causes a process failure, if the difference between air- and process temperature is below 8.6 K and the tool\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rotational speed is below 1380 rpm. This is the case for 115 data points.\r\npower failure (PWF): the product of torque and rotational speed (in rad/s) equals the power required for the process. If this power is below 3500 W or above 9000 W, the process fails, which is the case 95 times in our dataset.\r\noverstrain failure (OSF): if the product of tool wear and torque exceeds 11,000 minNm for the L product variant (12,000 M, 13,000 H), the process fails due to overstrain. This is true for 98 datapoints.\r\nrandom failures (RNF): each process has a chance of 0,1 % to fail regardless of its process parameters. This is the case for only 5 datapoints, less than could be expected for 10,000 datapoints in our dataset.\r\n\r\nIf at least one of the above failure modes is true, the process fails and the 'machine failure' label is set to 1. It is therefore not transparent to the machine learning method, which of the failure modes has caused the process to fail ",

    "abstract": "Detection of mines buried in the ground is very important in terms of safety of life and property. Many different methods have been used in this regard; however, it has not yet been possible to achieve 100% success. Mine detection process consists of sensor design, data analysis and decision algorithm phases. The magnetic anomaly method works according to the principle of measuring the anomalies resulting from the object in the magnetic field that disturbs the structure of it, the magnetic field, and the data obtained at this point are used to determine the conditions such as motion and position. The determination of parameters such as position, depth or direction of motion using magnetic anomaly has been carried out since 1970.",

    "abstract": "The dataset consists of 110,204 admissions of 84,811 hospitalized subjects between 2011 and 2012 in Norway who were diagnosed with infections, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, sepsis by causative microbes, or septic shock.  The prediction task is to determine whether a patient survived or is deceased at a time of about 9 days after collecting their medical record at the hospital.\n\nThis is an important prediction problem in clinical medicine. Sepsis is a life-threatening condition triggered by an immune overreaction to infection, leading to organ failure or even death. Sepsis is associated with immediate death risk, often killing patients within one hour. This renders many laboratory tests and hospital analyses impractical for timely diagnosis and treatment. Being able to predict the survival of patients within minutes with as few and easy-to-retrieve medical features as possible is very important.",

      "summary": "The experimental testbed for occupancy estimation was deployed in a 6m x 4.6m room. The setup consisted of 7 sensor nodes and one edge node in a star configuration with the sensor nodes transmitting data to the edge every 30s using wireless transceivers. No HVAC systems were in use while the dataset was being collected.\n\nFive different types of non-intrusive sensors were used in this experiment: temperature, light, sound, CO2 and digital passive infrared (PIR). The CO2, sound and PIR sensors needed manual calibration. For the CO2 sensor, zero-point calibration was manually done before its first use by keeping it in a clean environment for over 20 minutes and then pulling the calibration pin (HD pin) low for over 7s. The sound sensor is essentially a microphone with a variable-gain analog amplifier attached to it. Therefore, the output of this sensor is analog which is read by the microcontroller\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ADC in volts. The potentiometer tied to the gain of the amplifier was adjusted to ensure the highest sensitivity. The PIR sensor has two trimpots: one to tweak the sensitivity and the other to tweak the time for which the output stays high after detecting motion. Both of these were adjusted to the highest values. Sensor nodes S1-S4 consisted of temperature, light and sound sensors, S5 had a CO2 sensor and S6 and S7 had one PIR sensor each that were deployed on the ceiling ledges at an angle that maximized the sensor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s field of view for motion detection.\n\nThe data was collected for a period of 4 days in a controlled manner with the occupancy in the room varying between 0 and 3 people. The ground truth of the occupancy count in the room was noted manually.\n\nPlease refer to our publications for more details.",

      "summary": "Data sources are medical records, personal interviews, and the National Death Index (NDI). For each patient administrative records data, clinical data and survey data were collected.\nThe objective of the SUPPORT project was to improve decision-making in order to address the growing national concern over the loss of control that patients have near the end of life and to reduce the frequency of a mechanical, painful, and prolonged process of dying. SUPPORT comprised a two-year prospective observational study (Phase I) followed by a two-year controlled clinical trial (Phase II). Phase I of SUPPORT collected data from patients accessioned during 1989-1991 to characterize the care, treatment preferences, and patterns of decision-making among critically ill patients. It also served as a preliminary step for devising an intervention strategy for improving critically-ill patients' care and for the construction of statistical models for predicting patient prognosis and functional status. An intervention was implemented in Phase II of SUPPORT, which accessioned patients during 1992-1994. The Phase II intervention provided physicians with accurate predictive information on future functional ability, survival probability to six months, and patients' preferences for end-of-life care. Additionally, a skilled nurse was provided as part of the intervention to elicit patient preferences, provide prognoses, enhance understanding, enable palliative care, and facilitate advance planning. The intervention was expected to increase communication, resulting in earlier decisions to have orders against resuscitation, decrease time that patients spent in undesirable states (e.g., in the Intensive Care Unit, on a ventilator, and in a coma), increase physician understanding of patients' preferences for care, decrease patient pain, and decrease hospital resource use. Data collection in both phases of SUPPORT consisted of questionnaires administered to patients, their surrogates, and physicians, plus chart reviews for abstracting clinical, treatment, and decision information. Phase II also collected information regarding the implementation of the intervention, such as patient-specific logs maintained by nurses assigned to patients as part of the intervention. SUPPORT patients were followed for six months after inclusion in the study. Those who did not die within six months or were lost to follow-up were matched against the National Death Index to identify deaths through 1997. Patients who did not die within one year or were lost to follow-up were matched against the National Death Index to identify deaths through 1997.\nAll patients in five United States medical centers who met inclusion and exclusion criteria for nine disease categories: acute respiratory failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, liver disease, coma, colon cancer, lung cancer, multiple organ system failure with malignancy, and multiple organ system failure with sepsis. SUPPORT is a combination of patients from 2 studies, each of which lasted 2 years. The first phase concerns 4,301 patients, whereas the second phase concerns 4,804 patients. Time wise, these studies were accessioned in 1989 (June 12) through 1991 (June 11) for phase I and in 1992 (January 7) through 1994 (January 24).",

The images depict various regions of interest, such as the abdomen\u2019s right lower quadrant, appendix, intestines, lymph nodes and reproductive organs. Alongside multiple US images for each subject, the dataset includes information encompassing laboratory tests, physical examination results, clinical scores, such as Alvarado and pediatric appendicitis scores, and expert-produced ultrasonographic findings. Lastly, the subjects were labeled w.r.t. three target variables: diagnosis (appendicitis vs. no appendicitis), management (surgical vs. conservative) and severity (complicated vs. uncomplicated or no appendicitis). The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Regensburg (no. 18-1063-101, 18-1063_1-101 and 18-1063_2-101) and was performed following applicable guidelines and regulations.",
